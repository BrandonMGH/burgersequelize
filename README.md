**Section 15  EAT-DA-BURGER APP SEQUELIZE**


**Assignment Details:**

In this assignment, we had to use a combination of our knowledge the node.js enviornment, server routing, ORMs and SQL database technology in conjuction with our front end code as created by the Handlebars framework to create an Eat-Da-Burger App that allowed users to enter in a burger that they wanted to eat,add that burger to a table listing, then click on a devour button to eat the burger and move the burger to a separate table that indicated that the burger had been devoured.  A remove button was also added in as well so as to use all aspects of the "C.R.U.D." persistant storage functions.  All these options would update the client side document as well as update the SQL table database.
